1,"Design a Real-time Gaming Leaderboard","Average of 5 million daily active users (DAU) and 25 million monthly active users (MAU) playing around 10 games per day. each game adds point to gamers score. QPS for reading ten times less than write qps. strong consistency is a must. global distribution, assume only one game type","would the design change if we raise both write and read QPS x100? ","Should use underlying structure which is sorted and allow fast inserts (skip list, B+ tree), in the phase2 sharding with fixed of hashed partitions."
2,"Design a Google URL Shortener","Internal ecosystem usage, ~1M links generated per year, read:write ratio 10:1. Focus on simple hashing and redirection.","Public launch, expect 1B links/year. 100:1 read ratio. Analytics required. Global low latency constraints invalidating single DB.","Phase 1: Simple hashing (Base62) + relational DB. Phase 2: Distributed KGS (Key Generation Service), heavy caching (Redis/Memcached), Geo-DNS, and separate analytics pipeline."
3,"Design a Real-time Messaging App","1-on-1 text messaging only. 10k concurrent users. Focus on message delivery reliability and order.","Scale to 100M concurrent users. Support group chats (up to 500 people). Media (images/video) support. Last seen status.","Phase 1: WebSocket connection management, simple store. Phase 2: Gateway service, Session management, Message queues for fan-out (group chat), Blob storage for media + CDN, HBase/Cassandra for chat history."
4,"Design a Photo Sharing Service","Instagram-like MVP. User uploads photo, followers see it. 1M DAU. Feed is chronological.","500M DAU. Algorithmic feed generation. Smart cropping. Global distribution. Handling celebrity users with 50M followers.","Phase 1: SQL simple relationship. Push model for feed. Phase 2: Hybrid Pull/Push model for celebrities. Async media processing/compression. Feed pre-computation stored in Redis/Cassandra. Sharding by UserID."
5,"Design a Web Crawler","Crawl a tailored list of 100,000 news websites daily. Extract text and title. Respect robots.txt.","Crawl the entire visible web (billions of pages). Update frequency varies by page popularity. Handle infinite loops and spam traps.","Phase 1: BFS/DFS with visited set in DB. Phase 2: URL Frontier with priority queues (Kafka). Distributed workers. Bloom filter for visited URLs. DNS Resolver caching. Checkpointing."
6,"Design a Distributed Key-Value Store","Single-node implementation supporting get/put. In-memory with disk persistence (WAL). Strong consistency.","Cluster mode. Partition tolerance. High availability (AP system). Tunable consistency (Quorum). Handle node failures/additions.","Phase 1: Hash map + WAL. Phase 2: Consistent Hashing for data partitioning. Gossip protocol for membership. Vector clocks for conflict resolution. Merkle trees for anti-entropy."
7,"Design a Notification Service","Send transactional emails (Welcome, Password Reset) for a SaaS app. 10k emails/day. Synchronous API.","Unified platform for Email, SMS, Push (iOS/Android). 10M notifications/hour. Priority (OTP > Marketing). Deduplication.","Phase 1: SMTP wrapper. Phase 2: Message Queues (RabbitMQ/Kafka) separating priorities. Workers for different providers (SendGrid, Twilio, APNS). Rate limiting per user. Deduplication window."
8,"Design a Rate Limiter","Library to limit API requests for a single server application. Parameters: UserID, N requests per minute.","Distributed Rate Limiter Service for a microservice mesh. High precision. Low latency overhead (<10ms). Handle burst traffic.","Phase 1: Token Bucket in memory. Phase 2: Distributed Token Bucket using Redis + Lua script. Sliding Window Log for precision. Race condition handling. Service sidecar pattern."
9,"Design a Source Code Sharing Platform","Text storage. Unique URL generation. Optional password protection. 1k pastes/day. 1MB max size.","Syntax highlighting. User accounts with history. Permanent storage vs auto-expiry. Analytics. 10M writes/day.","Phase 1: Blob storage + metadata DB. Phase 2: Object Store (S3). Paste expiry service (cleanup job). CDN for popular public pastes. Search functionality (Elasticsearch)."
10,"Design a Cloud File Storage Service","Upload and download files up to 1GB. Directory structure. 10TB total storage. Single region.","Cross-device sync. Block-level deduplication (rsync style). 100PB storage. Global replication. Offline edits.","Phase 1: File server + metadata DB. Phase 2: Chunking files into blocks. Content Addressable Storage (CAS) for deduplication. Metadata DB separate from Block Storage (S3/Glacier). Delta sync."
